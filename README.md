# ArachnidRobotics-Assignment





# Assumptions

## Movement directions
The first assumption I had to make was how the different commands interacted with the spider robot, I have gone with the following:

Assuming that (0,0) is the top left of a quadrant of the space:
(0,0) F = (0, 1);
(0,0) B = (0, -1);
(0,0) R = (1, 0);
(0,0) L = (-1, 0);




## Tracking Direction
For this I've decided to use a class as this lets me keep the data and the functions to modify the data in together.

# Testing
